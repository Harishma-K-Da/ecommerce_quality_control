# E-commerce Product Image Quality Control using Deep Learning

This project automates the quality control process of product images in an e-commerce platform using deep learning. It ensures that only high-quality, relevant product images are showcased, ultimately enhancing customer experience and building trust.

## Features

- Image classification using a fine-tuned deep learning model
- Filters out irrelevant or low-quality product images
- Preprocessing pipeline to standardize and clean incoming images

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
